## What is Hypothesis Generation?

Hypothesis generation is the process of proposing natural language theories or explanations about observed phenomena. This is a crucial step in scientific discovery and everyday reasoning. For example:

- In science: Inferring the heliocentric model from observations of planets and moons
- In daily life: Proposing reasons why one didn't get admitted to college

## Real World Datasets

HypoBench includes the following real-world datasets that span various domains:

### Deception Detection
- **Task Description**: Distinguish genuine and fake hotel reviews based on subtle linguistic cues.
- **IND Dataset**: 1,600 hotel reviews (800 genuine and 800 fake).
- **OOD Dataset**: 640 hotel reviews collected from different source websites and cities.

### AI-Generated Content (AIGC) Detection
- **Task Description**: Identify whether a story is human-written or AI-generated given a writing prompt.
- **IND Dataset**: 800 writing prompts with corresponding stories.
- **OOD Dataset**: 800 stories generated by alternative models.

### Persuasive Argument Prediction
- **Task Description**: Predict which text is more persuasive between pairs of arguments.
- **IND Dataset**: 750 pairs of arguments with persuasiveness labels.
- **OOD Dataset**: 500 pairs from different original sources.

### Mental Stress Detection
- **Task Description**: Detect mental stress signals from Reddit posts across different communities.
- **IND Dataset**: 1,000 Reddit post segments with stress labels.
- **OOD Dataset**: 500 posts from different subreddits.

### News Headline Engagements
- **Task Description**: Given a pair of headlines for the same news article, predict which one will get more clicks.
- **IND Dataset**: 700 headline pairs with engagement data.
- **OOD Dataset**: 453 headline pairs from different sources.

### Retweets Prediction
- **Task Description**: Given a pair of tweets, predict which one will be retweeted more.
- **IND Dataset**: 1,000 tweet pairs with retweet counts.
- **OOD Dataset**: 500 tweet pairs from different domains.

### Paper Citations
- **Task Description**: Classify whether an academic paper will receive high or low citations.
- **IND Dataset**: 1,182 academic papers with citation data.
- **OOD Dataset**: 1,104 papers from different research fields.

## Synthetic Datasets

HypoBench includes carefully controlled synthetic datasets at different complexity levels:

### Presidential Election
- **Task Description**: Given a person's tweet, predict which political party they will vote for in the 2024 election.
- **Variants**: 78 different configurations
- **Size**: 178,750 samples

### Personality Prediction
- **Task Description**: Determine personal preferences of users based on their tweets' content, sentiment, and language patterns.
- **Variants**: 76 different configurations
- **Size**: 178,750 samples

### College Admission
- **Task Description**: Predict whether a student will be admitted based on their background information.
- **Variants**: 26 different configurations
- **Size**: 7,800 samples
- **Controlled Factors**:
  - Number of features
  - Compositionality (depth of feature interactions)
  - Noise in outcome
  - Number of distractors

### Shoe Sales
- **Task Description**: Given a customer's appearance, predict which shoe they will buy.
- **Variants**: 3 different configurations
- **Size**: 3,300 samples

### Marine Ecosystem
- **Task Description**: Given information about a marine ecosystem, predict the daily sunlight hours received at the location.
- **Variants**: 1 configuration
- **Size**: 500 samples

The synthetic datasets enable direct evaluation of how well models can recover known ground-truth hypotheses at varying levels of difficulty.
