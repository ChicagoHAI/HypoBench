# HypoBench: A Benchmark for Hypothesis Generation

HypoBench is a systematic and principled benchmark designed to evaluate the hypothesis generation capabilities of AI systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs).

## What is HypoBench?

HypoBench provides a comprehensive framework for assessing how well models can generate plausible hypotheses that explain observed phenomena. Our benchmark:

- Combines real-world and synthetic datasets across multiple domains
- Evaluates multiple dimensions of hypothesis quality, with emphasis on explanatory power
- Enables systematic comparison between different methods and models

## Why Hypothesis Generation?

Hypothesis generation is ubiquitous in scientific discoveries and everyday reasoning. It involves proposing natural language theories or explanations about observed phenomena, requiring key capabilities like:

- Inductive reasoning
- Abstraction and clear communication
- Synthesis of information

## Key Findings

Our experiments have revealed several important insights:

- Data-driven hypothesis generation methods outperform both zero-shot and few-shot inference approaches
- Combining literature with data for hypothesis generation achieves the best performance
- Current methods struggle with more complex hypothesis generation tasks, with performance dropping as difficulty increases
- There remains substantial room for improvement in this important area
